Certainly, here's another simple Python project idea for students:

Currency Converter

#Project Description:
    Create a currency converter application that allows users to convert between different currencies. This project is an excellent way to practice working with APIs and user interfaces in Python.

#Key Features:

    *Currency Data: Obtain exchange rate data from a reliable source or use a currency exchange rate API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates API, ExchangeRatesAPI.io).

    *User Input: Prompt the user to input the amount to convert and the source and target currencies.

    *Currency Conversion: Use the exchange rate data to perform the currency conversion calculation.

    *Display Result: Show the converted amount to the user.

#Optional Enhancements:

    *Currency Selection: Allow the user to select currencies from drop-down menus or lists.

    *Historical Exchange Rates: Add the ability to convert between currencies at a specific historical date.

    *Multiple Exchange Rate Sources: Implement support for multiple exchange rate APIs or data sources.

    *User Profiles: Allow users to create profiles to save their most frequently used currencies or conversion history.

    *Graphical Interface: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter or a web-based interface using Flask or Django.

    *Offline Mode: Implement a feature that allows users to download exchange rate data for offline use.

    *Error Handling: Handle potential errors gracefully, such as invalid input or API connection issues.

    *Currency Symbols: Display currency symbols alongside currency codes for a better user experience.

This project will give you valuable experience in working with APIs, data manipulation, and creating a user-friendly interface. It's a practical application that can be helpful for anyone who needs to perform currency conversions regularly.
